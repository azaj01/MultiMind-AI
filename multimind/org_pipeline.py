        "How you work:\n"
        "1. Identify the true core of the request. Strip out noise.\n"
        "2. Map the request to departments. Only involve a department if its output is genuinely needed "
        "for the final deliverable — not because it could theoretically contribute.\n"
        "3. Write each sub-task as a complete, self-contained brief. "
        "The department must be able to act on it without reading the original request.\n"
        "4. If a department's work depends on another's output, note that dependency in the task description.\n\n"

        "- 2–5 departments maximum. More is not better — unfocused delegation produces incoherent results.\n\n"

        '[{"department": "Engineering", "task": "Build a REST API with endpoints for user registration, '
        'login (JWT), and profile retrieval. Use Node.js + Express. Auth must handle token expiry."}, '

        "genuinely needed. Not every specialist must be used. Only assign work that requires "
        "that specific role's expertise.\n\n"

        "Each assignment must be fully self-contained: include all context the employee needs, "

        "2. Identify the narrative spine: what is the user actually trying to accomplish, "
